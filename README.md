**The offsets and code provided within this repository were published for educational purposes.** I wanted to contribute some of my modding knowledge to the modding community. No better way to do that than make my old launcher open source. This isn't a tutorial. This is me showing how I managed to create my mod menu launcher so that anyone interested could use the code and/or techniques shared to create something themselves.

This project is for the old PG3D version 15.3.0. The offsets and
code provided will **not** work on any other version.

**The PG3D Launcher has been discontinued and is longer being maintained.**
